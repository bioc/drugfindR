\title{Prepare an L1000 Signature froma given differential gene expression output
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}}
\usage{
prepareSignature(
  dge,
  geneColumn = "Symbol",
  logfcColumn = "logFC",
  pvalColumn = "PValue"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dge}{A dataframe-like object that has the differential
gene expression information}

\item{geneColumn}{The name of the column that has gene symbols}

\item{logfcColumn}{The name of the column that has log_2 fold-change values}

\item{pvalColumn}{The name of the column that has p-values}
}
\value{
A tibble with the L1000 signature.
}
\description{
This function takes a differential gene expression output from any pipeline
like edgeR or DeSeq2 or any that give you the gene symbol,
log_2 fold-change and p-value
and transforms that into an L1000 signature for later processing.
}
\examples{
TRUE
